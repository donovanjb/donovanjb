# Hi, I'm Donovan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at Columbia University studying Operations Research with a concentration in Financial Engineering. Throughout my college journey, I've worked on a variety of projects that span applied optimization, machine learning, and reinforcement learning applications. All of these projects were built using Python and its powerful ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and PyTorch.

## What I Do
- **Applied Optimization:** Developing algorithms and models for optimization problems.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Building predictive models and neural networks.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Experimenting with agents and environment interactions to solve complex problems.

## Projects Highlights
- **Optimization Tools:** Implemented models and algorithms to solve real-life resource allocation and scheduling problems.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Developed machine learning models that forecast trends and provide actionable insights.
- **Reinforcement Learning Applications:** Designed and trained agents in simulated environments, pushing the envelope on adaptive learning methodologies.

## Technologies I Use
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, PyTorch
