# Hi, I'm Donovan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at Columbia University studying Operations Research with a concentration in Financial Engineering. Throughout my college journey, I've worked on a variety of projects that span applied optimization, machine learning, and reinforcement learning applications. All of these projects were built using Python and its powerful ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and PyTorch.
